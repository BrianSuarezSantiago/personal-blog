My path into the cloud and AWS started in a very unconventional way. About two years ago, during the final year of my bachelor’s degree, I joined a major AWS Partner as a Cloud Engineer intern without any previous experience in AWS or even a clear understanding of what cloud computing and AWS really were. I jumped directly into a professional environment, working with real customers and experienced teams, and learned everything from the ground up. I quickly became interested and genuinely liked the world of cloud computing, especially with AWS as a provider, so I began to train and work more with AWS.

Almost two years later, I have moved up three professional categories, from internship student to my current role as Cloud Architect. I have had the opportunity to be part of an AWS User Group, attend two AWS Summit events, obtain several certifications, attend AWS re:Invent as part of the All Builders Welcome Grant program, give internal talks at my company about AWS services and architectures, and help colleagues with growing their own skills with AWS.

Nowadays, I also write technical posts about AWS on my personal blog as a way to share what I learn and give back to the community. Coming from a background where I entered the cloud world with no prior exposure gives me a different perspective. I strongly believe that community is everything, that it is where real learning starts, and that teaching others is one of the best ways to truly understand how things work. That belief is what drives me to contribute, share knowledge, and build a community around AWS.

So, taking into account that I come from a non-traditional cloud background and having had to learn AWS from zero in a real production environment, this allows me to connect with beginners, translate complex concepts into practical knowledge, and actively contribute by sharing and teaching within the community.

One practical project I built using AWS came from a real problem at home. We had a large number of important documents scattered across different places, such as mortgage contracts and payment receipts, loan documents, home, car, and health insurance policies, appliance warranties, and utility bills for electricity, water, and internet. Whenever I needed to review one of these documents, I often did not remember where it was stored, in which folder or section it belonged, or which specific clause applied to my situation.

To solve this, I built a simple but effective personal document management solution using AWS. I used Amazon S3 as a single, centralized repository to store all documents, including PDFs and scanned images. On top of that, I created a knowledge base using Amazon Bedrock to index and extract information from these documents. I then built a Bedrock Agent that acts as a conversational interface, allowing me to ask questions in natural language and retrieve precise answers directly from my own documents.

Some real examples of questions I can now ask are when the dishwasher warranty expires, whether my home insurance covers a water pipe leak, how much I paid for electricity in November compared to October, or what the penalty is for canceling my internet contract. Instead of searching manually through folders or reading long contracts, I get clear and contextual answers in seconds.

The value of this project has been very tangible. It saves me a significant amount of time, reduces stress when dealing with administrative tasks, and centralizes personal knowledge that was previously fragmented. From a learning perspective, I gained hands-on experience designing a simple end-to-end architecture with AWS services, working with document indexing and retrieval, and building practical, real-world applications with generative AI that solve everyday problems.
