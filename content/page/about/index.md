Hello 👋🏻!

My name is Brian Suárez and this is my personal website. I'm a Cloud Engineer, specializing in AWS, DevOps and cloud-native development. With a career spanning over almos three years working on resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, I've worn many hats, including software engineer, consultant, trainer and software architect.

I work at [NTT DATA](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/) as a Cloud Engineer, where I help customers benefit from public cloud computing. I focus on AWS and due to sharing my experience on my blog, at meetups, and at conferences, I have been accepted into the [AWS Community Builder program](https://builder.aws.com/connect/community/community-builders) since January of 2026.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or sharing my expertise, you’ll find me experimenting with emerging technologies and contributing to open source.
